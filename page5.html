      <h1>Fairness vs Accuracy in AI Decision Making:</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Defining Fairness:</h2>
        <p>
          AI decision-making systems in healthcare have the potential to enhance
          diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and resource allocation.
          However, ethical dilemmas emerge concerning transparency,
          accountability, and the balance between algorithmic recommendations
          and human judgment. Additionally, biases embedded in training data can
          perpetuate disparities in healthcare delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simplest notion of fairness applied to the predictions or
          decisions of a model is known as statistical parity. Let's say a
          health insurance company is using a machine learning model to decide
          how much should the insurance premium be for individuals. Statistical
          parity demands that for the underlying groups of individuals (based on
          rance and other criterion) pay the same amount of money on average. It
          does not take into consideration about the actual health risks of
          indivudls. But this might lead to a completely fair system because
          people who does not need that much medical attension may end up paying
          more that they should just to ensure statistical parity. Problem with
          statistical parity is that it can be violated even when the algorithm
          is making "perfect" decisions.

        <h2>Fairness Fighting Accuracy:</h2>
        <p>
          Fairness refers to the equitable treatment of individuals from
          different demographic groups, ensuring that the model's predictions
          are not biased or discriminatory. Accuracy, on the other hand,
          measures how well the machine learning model performs in making
          correct predictions overall. The trade-off between fairness and
          accuracy often arises because addressing bias or discrimination in a
          model's predictions may result in a decrease in overall accuracy. This
          is because bias mitigation techniques, such as modifying the model's
          algorithms or adjusting the training data, may lead to a reduction in
          predictive performance. As a result, when evaluating machine learning
          models, developers often need to make a trade-off between fairness and
          accuracy. The Pareto curve can help visualize this trade-off by
          showing the range of solutions where improvements in fairness are
          accompanied by decreases in accuracy, and vice versa. Finding the
          optimal balance between fairness and accuracy involves selecting a
          point on the Pareto curve that best aligns with the priorities and
          values of the stakeholders involved.
